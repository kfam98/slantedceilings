        <h1>What is Slanted Ceilings</h1>
        <p>Slanted Ceilings is what four students at Cornell University call home next year. The name originated from the four bedroom
        apartment's distinct ceilings. The ceilings are characterized by their simplistic angles. Unlike other apartments whose ceilings
        are all but slanted, this 4 bedroom apartment thrives on its uniquesness and will impart wisdom on whoever resides in its space.</p>

                      One of the incoming residents of Slanted Ceilings encountered this 4 bedroom apartment
                      on the Internet. Nothing too special, but when Cedric and the others looked at the pictures
                      on the website, they knew that this apartment was the one.

                      After the tour, the students had a decision to make as others soon discovered Slanted Ceilings, and
                      fell in love. They decided to follow through with the next steps of making the apartment theirs.
                      It was time to sign the lease. However, as time went on and the lease signing came closer, one of
                      their own couldn't make it, and thus, there were 4 to sign the lease minus one.

                      Since Kelly couldn't make it to the lease signing, the other residents found that the punishment that
                      seemed fit for her betrayal and untimely manner was to give her the small room. Seeing that she was a
                      small person, it fit all too well. Stay tuned.
